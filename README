This is the README file for Sybase::Login

Sybase::Login is a perl5 package which implements a configurable
Login widget for use with Sybase.  To use Sybase::Login, you will
need Perl version 5.002 or better, Tk-b11.02 or better, and
sybperl-2.05 or better.

To build this extension, simply enter:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

There are no test routines for Sybase::Login.  A sample program is
included within the Login.pm pod section.


Version 1.3 now includes two additional configuration parameters
to control display of database and server menus
